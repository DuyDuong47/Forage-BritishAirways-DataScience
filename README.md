# BritishAirways-DataScience
Uncover company insights and predict customer buying behavior with our Data Science team.

# Task 1: Web scraping to gain company insights
Scrape and analyze customer review data to uncover findings for British Airways
## Background information
British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether for holidays, work, or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently, and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many essential responsibilities.

As a data scientist at BA, it will be your job to apply your analytical skills to influence real-life multi-million-pound decisions from day one, making a tangible impact on the business as your recommendations, tools, and models drive key business decisions, reduce costs, and increase revenue.

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

## Tasks
This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback reviewing data from a third-party source and analyzing this data to present any insights you may uncover.
1. Scrape data from the web: The first thing to do will be to scrape review data from the web. For this, you should use a website called Skytrax (https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways). The team leader wants you to focus on reviews specifically about the airline itself. You should collect as much data as you can to improve the output of your analysis.
   
2. Analyse data: Once you have your dataset, you need to prepare it. The data will be very messy and contain purely text. You will need to perform data cleaning to prepare the data for analysis. When the data is clean, you should perform your analysis to uncover some insights. As a starting point, you could look at topic modeling, sentiment analysis, or word clouds to provide some insight into the content of the reviews. It is recommended to complete this task using Python, however, you can use any tool that you wish.
   
3. Present insights: Your manager would like you to summarise your findings within a single PowerPoint slide so that they can present the results at the next board meeting. You should create visualizations and metrics to include within this slide, as well as clear and concise explanations to quickly provide the key points from your analysis.

# Task 2: Predicting customer buying behavior
Build a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behavior
## Background information
Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. This is one of the reasons the buying cycle is very different from what it used to be. Today, if you’re hoping that a customer purchases your flights or holidays as they come into the airport, you’ve already lost! Being reactive in this situation is not ideal; airlines must be proactive to acquire customers before they embark on their holiday.

This is possible with the use of data and predictive models. The most important factor with a predictive model is the quality of the data you use to train the machine learning algorithms. For this task, you must manipulate and prepare the provided customer booking data so that you can build a high-quality predictive model.

With your predictive model, it is important to interpret the results to understand how “predictive” the data really was and whether we can feasibly use it to predict the target outcome (customers buying holidays). Therefore, you should evaluate the model's performance and output how each variable contributes to the predictive model's power.

## Task:
1. Explore and prepare the dataset: You should consider how to prepare the dataset for a predictive model. You should think about any new features you want to create to make your model even better. You can make use of the Resources provided to get you started with this task.
2. Train a machine learning model: When your data is ready for modeling, you should train a machine learning model to be able to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking. For this task, you should use an algorithm that easily allows you to output information about how each variable within the model contributes to its predictive power. For example, a RandomForest is very good for this purpose.
3. Evaluate the model and present findings: After training your model, you should evaluate how well it performed by conducting cross-validation and outputting appropriate evaluation metrics. Furthermore, you should create a visualization to interpret how each variable contributed to the model. Finally, you should summarise your findings in a single slide to be sent to your manager.
